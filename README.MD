#Graphics
##A basic 3d engine written in rust
This project is **WIP**, and you therefore should *not* expect any useful functionality for the foreseeable future.
Constructive criticism and ideas are welcome, and you are of course always welcome to fork the project (see the license
for more information) for any reason.

This is my first real go at rust, so please comment on bad code/style/logic whereever that shows up. There are of
course projects like this out there, this is most of all a learning experience.
